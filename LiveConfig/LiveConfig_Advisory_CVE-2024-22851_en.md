# LiveConfig Advisory (CVE-2024-22851)

# Table of Contents

# Description

LiveConfig® is a lightweight control panel software that aims to simplify server configuration and to care of reliable and safe operation.

The LiveConfig® software is prone to an unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability on the endpoint `static` in version < 2.5.2.
Recent versions of LiveConfig® are **not** vulnerable to this issue.
This allows an attacker to read data on the filesystem with the permissions of the 'liveconfig' user, which includes data from within LiveConfig® itself like customer data etc.

```bash
curl -s -k -X $'GET' --path-as-is 'https://test.machine:8443/static///////../../../../etc/passwd'
